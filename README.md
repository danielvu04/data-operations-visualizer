# Data Operations Visualizer  
### Real-time 3D visualization of data pipelines as a living, interactive city

Data Operations Visualizer is a real-time dashboard that transforms complex data operations into an intuitive 3D cityscape.  
Each "building" represents a processing node. Lights, colors, motion, and brightness change dynamically based on live system metrics such as throughput, latency, error rate, and backlog.

Inspired by real-world high-volume workflows (like healthcare claim pipelines, financial transaction flows, and logistics routing), this project makes operational health **understandable** for both managers and engineers.

## Key Features

### City-Based Data Visualization
- Buildings = System nodes (ingestion, validation, routing, enrichment, downstream systems)
- Height = Throughput  
- Brightness = System health  
- Color = SLA risk (green → amber → red)  
- Traffic flow = Processing activity  

### Real-Time Metrics Streaming
- Backend WebSocket server streams live metric frames 1–2 times per second  
- Metrics include:
  - Throughput per minute  
  - p95 latency  
  - Error rate  
  - Queue/backlog size  

### Manager Mode
- High-level KPIs: global latency, throughput, error rate, backlog
- Insight feed with plain-language event summaries
- SLA risk scoring with anomaly detection
- Aesthetic, simplified city view for non-technical audiences

### Engineer Mode
- Node drill-down panel with charts (latency history, error spikes, backlog trends)
- Raw JSON log previews
- WebSocket frame inspector
- Timeline scrubber to replay past incidents

### Story Mode (Playback)
- Scrub through historical data to replay outages, spikes, or high-load events
- Compare "Now" vs a selected point in history
- Visual markers for anomalies and insights

### What-If Simulation
- Modify simulation parameters: scale factor, routing distribution, latency profile
- Watch the city react immediately
- Useful for capacity discussions or architecture reviews
